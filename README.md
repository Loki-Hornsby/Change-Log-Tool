# Change-Log-Tool
- Stores Changelogs location and name
- More to be added soon.... 
   -   Changelog explorer, 
   -   Maybe (but seems very much like a gimmick (infact it is)): Changelog compatability perceptron (bassically a perceptron which looks through all your   other changelogs and sees if they match or if theres problems with them - such as a different format), 
   -   Settings menu, 
   -   Mergelog (merges all changelogs into a single file - with option to delete whats been merged or to keep it)
